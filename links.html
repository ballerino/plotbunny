		<h2> Helpful Links </h2>
		<div class=box>
		Writing is about more than your pen and paper. Due to creative writing software and technology, writing articles, web generators, writing and publishing communities, and more, writing is more interactive than before! Our helpful links pages will be updated weekly with new material. Remember, writing advice is subjective. Everyone writes differently. The links we provide are to be taken more as suggestions rather than professional reviews. (We are not paid to advertise any of the software or websites!) <br /> <br />
		Do you have a recommendation you want to share? Send us an email on our <a href="contact.html">contact</a> page.
