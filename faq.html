		Maryland Plot Bunny is a website created to help Maryland writers connect to writing peers in their area by providing lists of writing events and conferences to go to. We want writers to network, share, and become more confident in their writing. All people who call themselves writers are welcome to join, from hobbyists to professional writers!

		My name is Megan Tran, and I am the creator of the Maryland Plot Bunny website. I am part of an online Maryland writing community called Plot Bunnies. We decided we wanted a website to gather offline writing events and gatherings to connect with other writers in Maryland.
